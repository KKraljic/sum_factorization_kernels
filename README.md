# Directory Structure

The sub directory "legacy" contains the original code.
The directory "performance-tests" consists of a code snippet prepared for experimenting with OMP ("inner_loop") and another directory for experimenting with the matvec-kernel.

Please visit the READMEs of the sub directories for further instructions how to use the codes.
